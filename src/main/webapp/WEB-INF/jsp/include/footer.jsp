        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p>So that's it. This started out as 20 minutes of making fun of modern web dev. Then it turned into a few hours of it.</p>
        <p>I hope you've enjoyed looking at every modern website ever.</p>
        <p>I don't actually hate this style as long as the content is meaningful. In fact, I think this type of design is pretty cool and effective.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col four left">
        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p>CSS3 and HTML. JS for header shrinking; optional. Site works perfectly with JS disabled (another gripe of mine with modern web dev).</p>
        <p>Only external libraries are GFonts.</p>
        <p>Moderately responsive, should work on anything modern.</p>

        <h1>Why Mbting?</h1>
        <p>기존에 관심 있던 '중개' 분야에 도전하고 싶었습니다.</p>
        <p>'직방' 이나 '당근마켓'등 사람과 사람을 연결해주는 플랫폼이 돈이 된다는 것을 알았기 때문입니다.</p>
